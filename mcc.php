Today the Internet Web Service is the main way we access any kind of information from fixed or mobile terminals. Some of the information is stored in the Internet Cloud, where computing, communication, and storage services are main services provided for Internet users. In a non-distant future many of our queries will be beyond current Internet scope and will be about the people, the physical environments that surround us, and virtual environments that we will be involved. Having witnessed the phenomenal burst of research in cloud computing, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is to extend cloud computing functions, services and results to the world of future mobile applications. MCC will address issues that current Internet Clouds or Mobile Computing Technologies alone cannot effectively or efficiently address.
</p>

<p>
The MCC workshop is intended to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners in current mobile computing and cloud computing from academia, industry, and service providers, to share ideas, experiences, and practical implementations related to new MCC technologies and applications. Both position and working-in-progress papers are encouraged. Workshop participants will discuss emerging and future trends in research and application that integrate the cloud computing paradigm into mobile devices, mobile applications, security and privacy, and mobile services, evaluating the impact of mobile applications on cloud computing techniques. To that end, papers are solicited from all MCC related areas involving the interactions or integrations of mobile techniques and cloud computing solutions, including, but not limited to the following topics.
</p>

<h2 class="hcls">Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>All submissions must be original work not under review at any other workshop, 
  conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers describing completed 
  work as well as work-in-progress, so long as the promise of the approach is 
  demonstrated. Radical ideas, potentially of a controversial nature, are strongly 
  encouraged. Submissions must be no greater than 6 pages in length and must be 
  a pdf file. Reviews will be single-blind: authors name and affiliation should 
  be included in the submission. Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines 
  at <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/" >http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/</a>. </p>

<p>
Papers should be submitted via the <a href="http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/mcc.htm" rel="external" >submission site</a>. Papers must include the author name and affiliation for single-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop.
