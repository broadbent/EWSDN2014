<h2 class="hcls">Workshop on Online Social Networks (WOSN)</h2>

<p>
<b>Helsinki, Finland (Friday, August 17, 2012)</b>
</p>

<p>
With nearly half the world's population with access to the Internet
being present on an Online Social Network, the field has infiltrated
most walks of life. A significant fraction of mind-share in the form
of applications, diverse access interfaces, and a large economic
ecosystem has developed around this field. Going past the simple
characterization and enumeration of properties, the networking
research community has shown significant interest in attacking various
problems associated with OSNs. WOSN'12 will bring together networking
researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and important
questions posed by emerging social applications. Of particular
interest are problems related to system architecture design, explosion
of new media traffic, and mobile access. WOSN'12 will facilitate
cross-disciplinary discussion of relevance to computer networking
involving new ideas and applications and experimental results. The 
workshop solicits original papers on ongoing work as well as 
position papers. All papers are limited to 6 pages (10 pt).
