<h2 class="hcls">Call for Papers</h2>
<p>
With the popularity of smart phones and tablets, we are living in an
increasingly mobile world. Third-party mobile applications such as
Apple Siri, iCloud, and Yelp are rapidly growing everyday and greatly
enrich our lives. The eco-system for mobile applications is vibrant
and conducive to open innovation. Even one of the most popular mobile
OS -- Android operation system is open source. This allows many phone
and tablet vendors to innovate on the hardware and
firmware. Underpinning this mobile world, it is the cellular
networks. Unfortunately, the cellular networks present a rather
disheartening picture. They are closed, mostly proprietary, and
constructed using closed monolithic equipments. The innovation is
limited to a very small number of equipment vendors, not open to the
general research community. As a result, cellular networks are prone
to outages, dropped calls, performance problems, and hard to
manage. The closed nature of cellular networks threatens to derail the
mobile revolution or limit its true potential.</p>

<p>
Research innovation in mobile cellular networks is hampered by the
fact that most academic researchers have no access to cellular radios,
source codes of cellular network equipments, cellular network
management tools, and realistic network traces at scale. As a result,
most wireless research is conducted using WiFi. We believe this
situation much change. To effect change, this workshop brings network
operators, and academic researchers together to address the
problems. First, we would like academic researchers to understand
operational aspects of cellular network. Second, we would like
researchers from academia and industry to jointly identify the
challenges, and propose future designs so that cellular networks can
evolve to meet the growing challenges of a mobile world.
</p>

<p>
We encourage submission of both position papers
and work-in-progress papers on previously unpublished work on cellular networks.
