<h2 class="hcls">Introduction</h2>

<p>
While they are a relatively new phenomenon, games on smartphones have become wildly popular with users. Games consistently dominate the top purchases on mobile app marketplaces. With the intense competition that has ensued in this industry, games are now rapidly incorporating sophisticated technologies that have been adapted to the mobile computing environment, many of which are of growing importance to researchers. There are many research challenges across graphics, energy consumption, network latency, HCI, security, and sensor networking. While this field is interdisciplinary by nature, many proposed ideas have direct impact on how networking protocols and infrastructures are designed and managed.</p>
<p>
In this first Mobile Gaming workshop at SIGCOMM, we will bring together practitioners as well as interested researchers to discuss the latest developments in this growing field. We will identify what we have already achieved, the challenges that lie ahead, and promising avenues forward.
