<h2 class="hcls">Workshop on Measurements Up and Down the STack (W-MUST)</h2>

<p>
  <b>Helsinki, Finland (Friday, August 17, 2012)</b>
</p>

<p>
  Following the success of the first W-MUST workshop at SIGCOMM 2011, we are holding a second workshop this
  year. W-MUST aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the networking and HCI communities to
  share new ideas and experiences addressing the challenges of measuring networked applications on end-user
  platforms for purposes related to performance, privacy, security, diagnosis, and troubleshooting. We are
  particularly interested in gathering context related to user activity or reflecting measurement-derived
  information to users. Work that solely considers network-level traces is out of scope. This workshop
  encourages work toward understanding how to gather the user view and correlate it with lower-level
  measurements.
